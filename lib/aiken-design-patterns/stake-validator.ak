//// This pattern allows for delegating some computations to a given staking

//// The primary application for this is the so-called "withdraw zero trick,"

//// With a minimal spending logic (which is executed for each UTxO), and an
//// arbitrary withdrawal logic (which is executed only once), a much more
//// optimized script can be implemented.
